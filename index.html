            <p>Hi! My name is Adam Gallina, and I enjoy building simple game proof-of-concepts. I've completed a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Oregon State University, with a focus in Simulation/Game Programming. I like to make games that don’t take themselves too seriously, but still provide a fun experience to the player.</p>
            <p>I first began learning to make games in 2016 (2014 if you count <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/legodood/">Scratch</a>…) when I joined my high school’s Game Dev team to compete in the <a href="https://www.ogpc.info/">Oregon Game Programming Challenge</a>, and have continued learning since, making personal projects as well as submissions for various game jams.</p>
            <!--<p>More recently I’ve been looking into 3D/VR development, including starting more serious plans to publish my own title. The initial demo is still in the works, but the gameplay will allow you to solve puzzles in a VR environment...with a detachable head. You'll be able to set your head down on buttons, plates, etc while still controlling your body across the room!</p>-->

                    <p>Made for GMTK 2023, you play as Adventurer Bob, a fun, happy-go-lucky man just looking to strike it rich! This is completely normal dungeon crawling, mob looting gameplay, nothing strange at all about Bob's trusty backpack. It's gotten him through hundreds of dungeons after all, why would there be anything strange about it?</p>
