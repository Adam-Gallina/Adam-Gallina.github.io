            <p>Hi! My name is Adam Gallina, and I enjoy building simple game proof-of-concepts. I've completed a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Oregon State University, with a focus in Simulation/Game Programming. I like to make games that don’t take themselves too seriously, but still provide a fun experience to the player.</p>
            <p>I first began learning to make games in 2016 (2014 if you count <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/legodood/">Scratch</a>…) when I joined my high school’s Game Dev team to compete in the <a href="https://www.ogpc.info/">Oregon Game Programming Challenge</a>, and have continued learning since, making personal projects as well as submissions for various game jams.</p>
            <!--<p>More recently I’ve been looking into 3D/VR development, including starting more serious plans to publish my own title. The initial demo is still in the works, but the gameplay will allow you to solve puzzles in a VR environment...with a detachable head. You'll be able to set your head down on buttons, plates, etc while still controlling your body across the room!</p>-->
